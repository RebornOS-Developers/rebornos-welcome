Version 0.0.9
=============

GUI Changes
-----------
1. Removed the top right "hidden" `Close` button.
2. Fixed the text color of headings: `Documentation`, `Support`, and `Contribute`
3. Recreated from scratch a new, custom "About" Dialog box (from `GtkWindow` instead of `Gtk.AboutDialog`) to fix ghost buttons appearing on the Gnome Desktop. 
4. Fixed a bug which caused the application to become unresponsive when closed while links are still opening in a web-browser
5. Better credits with clickable links (email links only work if you have a mail client installed)

Backend
--------
1. Added Screenshots
2. Rename scripts
